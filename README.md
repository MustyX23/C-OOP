# 📚 C# Object-Oriented Programming Repository 📚


## 🔍 About the Repository 🔍

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my journey through the captivating realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C#!

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive summary of the C# OOP course I successfully completed at SoftUni Academy, earning a stellar score of 6.00. 🌟 This course was a transformative experience, equipping me with essential skills and knowledge that have laid a solid foundation for my programming endeavors.

## 🌟 C# OOP Course Summary 🌟

During this enlightening course, I delved deep into the intricacies of OOP, mastering the art of structuring code through classes and objects. I unlocked the potential of object-oriented modeling, honing my skills in crafting efficient and elegant software architectures. The bedrock principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism became second nature, enabling me to create flexible and scalable solutions.

🧩 Design patterns such as creational, structural, and behavioral were demystified, enriching my toolkit with strategies to tackle various coding challenges. I embraced the SOLID principles, a cornerstone of professional software design, ensuring my creations are adaptable, maintainable, and robust.

With a magnifying glass on debugging, I fine-tuned my ability to ensure the reliability of my code. The world of decorators unfolded, empowering me to inject new functionalities with grace and precision. Through meticulous unit testing and an exploration of Test Driven Development (TDD), I embraced a systematic approach to guarantee my software's dependability.
